## Overview

This is a personal AI/ML research knowledge base built from academic papers, concept glossaries, and cross-linked notes. Every paper is distilled into a structured Obsidian note with YAML frontmatter (title, authors, year, arXiv ID, citation count, tags, TL;DR), a full intuition-first explanation, and `[[wikilinks]]` connecting it to every related concept. The result is a single navigable graph where clicking any node — whether a paper or a sub-concept — reveals exactly how it fits into the broader ecosystem.

The writing philosophy is borrowed from Andrej Karpathy: lead with the concrete problem and why it matters, introduce the math only after the intuition is clear, and always give real numbers. Mamba doesn't just "improve inference throughput" — it delivers 5× throughput over a Transformer at the same quality. FlashAttention doesn't just "reduce memory" — it tiles attention into SRAM so the T×T matrix never touches HBM, saving 2–4× wall-clock time at zero approximation cost. Every note is written to that standard.

What makes this wiki distinct is a full citation intelligence layer on top of the content. Every core paper carries its real citation count from Semantic Scholar, a `cited_by_details` list of the ten most-cited downstream works, and arXiv IDs throughout. The live web demo exposes all of this through a Citation Explorer, an interactive D3 knowledge graph sized by citation count, and a full-text search interface — all from a single static site deployed automatically via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

### Citation Explorer

A master-detail two-panel layout — click the **Citation Explorer** tab to open it.

**Left panel** — ranked list of every paper with `citation_count > 0`, sorted descending:
- Each row: `#rank · title · year · proportional citation bar · count`
- Bar width proportional to citations (`citation_count / 100,000`), minimum 4 px so even small counts are visible
- Bar color by impact tier:
  - 🟣 Purple → 10,000+ citations
  - 🩵 Teal → 1,000–9,999 citations
  - 🔵 Blue → 100–999 citations
  - ⬜ Gray → under 100 citations
- Filter box at top to search the ranked list in real time

**Right panel — default state** (nothing clicked): summary dashboard showing:
- Total papers in wiki
- Total citations tracked
- Most cited paper
- Fastest growing paper (Mamba: 4,841 citations in 18 months)
- Citation cluster pills: Foundations · Efficiency · Inference · Hardware

**Right panel — paper selected**:
- Title, authors, year, and arXiv badge with external link
- Large citation count number + full-width color bar
- **What this paper introduced** — the note's TL;DR
- **Top 10 papers that cite this work** — ranked table with: title (clickable), year, ~citations, theme badge, arXiv ↗ link
  - Clicking a citing paper's title: loads its detail view if it exists in the wiki, otherwise opens `arxiv.org/abs/[id]` in a new tab
- **Related papers in this wiki** — all resolved `[[wikilinks]]` from the note shown as clickable pills; clicking one switches to the All tab and opens that note's detail panel
- **← All Papers** back button returns to the summary dashboard

### Knowledge Graph

- Interactive D3.js v7 force-directed graph (`graph.html`)
- Every node = one wiki note, sized logarithmically by `citation_count`; nodes without citation data sized by incoming link count
- Every edge = a `[[wikilink]]` connection between notes
- Color-coded by theme tag (foundations, efficiency, hardware, inference-optimization, scaling, synthesis, meta)
- Click any node → opens full note detail in the side panel
- Hover a node → highlights direct neighbors, dims everything else; tooltip shows title, year, citations, and TL;DR
- Filter by tag — dims non-matching nodes
- Legend: color = theme, node size = citation count (where available, else link count)
- Zoom, pan, drag nodes freely

### Knowledge Graph Enhancements

- Node color coding by research theme:
  - Purple → SSM / Mamba / sequence modeling papers
  - Teal → concept glossary stubs
  - Amber → inference optimization papers
  - Blue → hardware & systems papers
  - Green → foundational papers
  - Red → benchmarks & evaluation
- Color legend displayed in the top-left corner of the graph
- Node size legend displayed in the bottom-left:
  - Small = under 100 citations (sized by incoming link count)
  - Medium = 100–1,000 citations
  - Large = 1,000–10,000 citations
  - Extra large = 10,000+ citations (e.g. Attention Is All You Need)
- Theme colors update live when appearance mode is switched — no page reload

### Theme Navigation

Notes grouped by theme in the **By Theme** tab:

| Theme | Contents |
|---|---|
| Foundations | Self-attention, RLHF, open models |
| State Space Models | SSMs, linear RNNs, LSTM variants |
| Mixture-of-Experts | Sparse routing, load balancing |
| Inference Optimization | Speculative decoding, KV cache, draft models |

| Concepts & Glossary | 100+ sub-concept stub notes |

### Appearance Modes

- Three-way toggle in the nav bar: **System** / **Dark** / **Light**
- System: automatically follows your OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Dark: deep background (`#0d1117`), glowing colored nodes, high-contrast text
- Light: clean white background, rich color nodes, dark labels
- Preference saved between sessions via `localStorage` key `appearance`
- All components respond: cards, graph nodes, citation bars, side panel, legends

### Reading Progress Tracker

- Track your reading status per note directly in the browser — no account needed
- Three states per note: **Unread** / **Reading** / **Done**
- Click the status badge on any note card to cycle through states
- Progress bar at the top of the browse view: "X of Y notes done · M reading"
- Filter the grid by reading status: **All** / **Unread** / **Reading** / **Done**
- Progress filter applies across All, By Theme, and Timeline tabs
- State persisted in `localStorage` — survives page reloads and browser restarts

### Timeline View

- Horizontal scrollable timeline spanning **2017 to 2026**
- Papers arranged in columns by publication year — one column per year
- Each card shows: title, up to 3 tags, and theme color stripe
- Click any card to open the full note detail panel
- Color-coded by research theme — same scheme as the knowledge graph
- Concept stubs and reference notes without a year in a dedicated **Reference** column
- Reveals the field's evolution at a glance:
  - 2017 — Transformer (Attention Is All You Need)
  - 2022 — FlashAttention, S4 Structured State Spaces
  - 2023 — Mamba, RWKV, RetNet, LLaMA 2, FlashAttention-2
  - 2024 — xLSTM, Griffin, Mamba-2, Medusa, EAGLE
  - 2025–2026 — Speculative Decoding, KV Cache Optimization, DeepSeek-V4, Hardware Acceleration

### Math Rendering

- KaTeX renders LaTeX inline (`$O(n^2)$`) and display (`$$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$`)
- Math is protected during Markdown preprocessing so the renderer never mangles LaTeX delimiters
- Supports `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]` delimiters

Every concept links back to the paper where it originates, and every `[[wikilink]]` in a paper note resolves to a concept page — 0 orphan links.

### Citation Intelligence

The wiki includes a full citation intelligence layer: `wiki/Citation Map.md` tracks total Semantic Scholar citation counts for the six core papers plus their top-10 highest-impact downstream works. Every core paper's YAML frontmatter carries `citation_count` (integer), `arxiv` (arXiv ID string), `cited_by_top` (name list), and `cited_by_details` (list of dicts: title, year, citations, theme, arxiv) — all emitted by `build.py` into `notes.json` and consumed by the Citation Explorer in the web demo. The `wiki/🗺️ Dashboard.md` Obsidian dashboard includes a live **Citation Leaderboard** Dataview query. Papers with full `cited_by_details`: Attention Is All You Need, Mamba, xLSTM, Speculative Decoding, KV Cache Optimization, Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks.

## Workflow

```
PDF papers in raw/
      ↓
build_wiki.py  —  Claude API extracts & summarises
      ↓
wiki/*.md  —  structured notes with YAML frontmatter
      ↓
build.py  —  converts Markdown + math + wikilinks → JSON + HTML
      ↓
docs/notes.json  +  docs/index.html  +  docs/graph.html
      ↓
GitHub Actions  —  auto-deploys on every push to main
      ↓
https://MuhammadSaqlainAslam.github.io/my-llm-wiki
```

`build.py` handles: YAML frontmatter parsing, math protection (swap LaTeX for placeholders before Markdown rendering → restore raw LaTeX for KaTeX), Obsidian callout → HTML div conversion, `![[embed]]` → clickable link conversion, Dataview/Mermaid block stubbing, and emission of `id`, `title`, `authors`, `tags`, `year`, `tldr`, `aliases`, `links`, `citation_count`, `arxiv`, `cited_by_details`, and rendered `html` per note.

---

## How to Add a New Paper

1. Drop the PDF into `raw/`
2. `python build_wiki.py` — Claude API extracts and writes `wiki/<Title>.md`
3. `python build.py` — regenerates `docs/notes.json`
4. `git add . && git commit -m "Add <Paper>" && git push`
5. GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages in ~2 minutes

---

## How to Run Locally

```bash
pip install anthropic pymupdf markdown pyyaml
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
python build_wiki.py   # process new PDFs → wiki/*.md
python build.py        # regenerate docs/ from wiki/
open docs/index.html   # preview in browser
```

For the knowledge graph, serve locally to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/docs/graph.html
```
