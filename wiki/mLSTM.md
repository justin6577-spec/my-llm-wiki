# mLSTM (matrix xLSTM cell)

The mLSTM cell maintains a matrix state $C_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ updated via the [[Covariance update rule]] $C_t = f_t C_{t-1} + i_t v_t k_t^\top$. Crucially, the gates $f_t, i_t$ depend only on the current input $x_t$, not on the previous hidden state — this breaks the LSTM's hidden-to-hidden recurrence and makes the cell **fully parallelizable in training time**, just like attention. Retrieval is $C_t q_t$, equivalent to one step of [[Linear attention]] with built-in [[Exponential gating]]. mLSTM provides the [[Matrix memory]] that gives [[xLSTM]] its associative-recall ability.
