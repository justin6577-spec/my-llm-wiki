## TL;DR
WebArena is a self-hosted, realistic web environment where agents must complete long-horizon tasks (e.g., "find the cheapest red bike under $500") across live-simulated sites like Reddit, GitLab, and e-commerce stores — with only ~14% success rate for GPT-4 at launch.

## Intuition
Most agent benchmarks are toy environments — simplified grids or static QA. WebArena flips this: it spins up actual web apps (CMS, code repos, shopping sites) with real databases, cookies, and UI state. An agent must plan, navigate, click, type, and verify outcomes across multi-step trajectories that mirror what a human assistant would actually do at a browser. The gap between "knows the answer" and "can execute the task" becomes brutally visible here.

The 812 tasks span information retrieval, transaction execution, and cross-site reasoning. Success is measured programmatically (did the correct item get added to cart? was the issue filed?) — no LLM-as-judge shortcut. This forces agents to close the loop between language understanding and grounded action, exposing failures in planning, error recovery, and long-context coherence.

## Why It Matters
- **Exposes the action gap**: GPT-4 at ~14% success reveals that strong language understanding does not transfer to reliable multi-step web execution — a critical calibration point for agent deployment.
- **Grounded evaluation**: Functional correctness via environment state (not string matching or human rating) makes scores hard to game and directly comparable across architectures.
- **Stresses long-context + memory**: Tasks require tracking state across many browser steps, pushing [[KV Cache]] limits and revealing where context management breaks down in practice.
