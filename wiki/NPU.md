# NPU (Neural Processing Unit)

An NPU is the on-chip neural-network accelerator inside modern phones, laptops, and edge devices. The design priorities are inverted from datacenter GPUs: instead of maximum FLOPS, the goal is maximum perf-per-watt within a tiny power envelope (≤ 5 W typical). NPUs use heavy quantization (INT8, sometimes INT4), small static dataflows, and tight integration with the surrounding SoC. They aren't general-purpose — most NPUs only run a fixed set of operator types — but for deployed inference workloads (camera ML, on-device LLMs, speech) they offer 10–100× better energy efficiency than the same task on a CPU.
