## Claude Opus 4.8 (May 28, 2026)

Source: Anthropic official announcement (May 2026).
See [[Opus 4.8 Benchmarks]] for full analysis.

### Agentic & Coding

| Benchmark | Opus 4.8 | Opus 4.7 | GPT-5.5 | Gemini 3.1 Pro |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **SWE-Bench Pro** (Pass@1) | **69.2%** | 64.3% | 58.6% | 54.2% |
| **Terminal-Bench 2.1** (Pass@1) | 74.6% | 66.1% | **78.2%** | 70.3% |
| **OSWorld-Verified** (Pass@1) | **83.4%** | 82.8% | 78.7% | 76.2% |
| **Finance Agent v2** (Pass@1) | **53.9%** | 51.5% | 51.8% | 43.0% |

### Reasoning

| Benchmark | Opus 4.8 | Opus 4.7 | GPT-5.5 | Gemini 3.1 Pro |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **HLE** — no tools (Pass@1) | **49.8%** | 46.9% | 41.4% | 44.4% |
| **HLE** — with tools (Pass@1) | **57.9%** | 54.7% | 52.2% | 51.4% |
| **GDPval-AA** (Elo) **(independent)** | **1890** | 1753 | 1769 | 1314 |

**Notes:**
- Terminal-Bench 2.1: GPT-5.5 uses Codex CLI harness; other models use Terminus-2 harness — not directly comparable.
- OSWorld uses updated harness in 4.8 — part of the gain is methodology, not pure model improvement.
- 4× improvement in unflagged code flaws (internal honesty metric; not independently verified).

## Claude Opus 4.6 (February 5, 2026)

Source: Anthropic official system card (February 2026).

### Long Context

| Benchmark | Opus 4.6 | Sonnet 4.5 | GPT-5.2 | Gemini 3 Pro |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|--------------|
| MRCR v2 1M 8-needle (MMR) | **76%** | 18.5% | 18.5% | 26.3% |
| MRCR v2 256k 8-needle (MMR) | **~77%** | — | — | 77% |

> **MRCR = Multi-Round Coreference Resolution.** 8-needle = hardest setting; 1M = prompts with (524k, 1024k] tokens. Score = Mean Match Ratio. Opus 4.6 leads all models as of June 2026 — Opus 4.7 regressed on this benchmark.

> ⚠️ **Score discrepancy:** The broader model comparison table below (from an internal image) shows Opus-4.6 MRCR 1M at **92.9**. The official system card shows **76%** (MRCR v2, 8-needle hardest variant). Likely causes: different MRCR variant (v1 vs v2), different needle count, or different context-length bin. **Use 76% when citing from the official system card.**

### Core Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| SWE-bench Verified (Resolved) | 80.84% | |
| SWE-bench Pro (Resolved) | 57.3% | |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 (Acc) | 65.4% | State-of-the-art at release |
| OSWorld-Verified (Pass@1) | 72.7% | |
| ARC-AGI-2 (Pass@1) | 68.8% | |
| GPQA Diamond (Pass@1) | 91.3% | |
| HLE with tools (Pass@1) | 53.0% | Updated Feb 23 2026 after cheating-detection improvement |
| HLE without tools (Pass@1) | ~40.0% | |
| GDPval-AA (Elo) **(independent)** | 1,606 | 144 pts ahead of GPT-5.2 at evaluation date |
| BrowseComp (Pass@1) | SOTA | Leads all frontier models |

> ⚠️ **GDPval-AA discrepancy:** The broader comparison table below shows 1,619 Elo; the official system card shows 1,606. Difference of 13 points — likely different evaluation date or Elo pool. Use 1,606 from the official system card.

**Key facts:**
- Released February 5, 2026; pricing $5/$25 per 1M tokens.
- First Opus with 1M token context (beta, premium pricing above 200k tokens).
- Best long-context model of 2026 — Opus 4.7 regressed on MRCR v2.
- HLE with tools updated from 53.1% to 53.0% on February 23 2026 after cheating-detection pipeline improvement.

## TL;DR

No single model wins everywhere. Gemini-3.1-Pro High dominates Knowledge & Reasoning. Opus-4.6 Max leads long-context (76% MRCR v2 8-needle per official system card). Agentic tasks are fragmented: GPT-5.4 leads GDPval-AA and Terminal Bench; K2.6 leads SWE Pro and HLE-with-tools; Opus-4.6 leads SWE Verified, SWE Multilingual, and MCPAtlas. DS-V4-Pro is the strongest open model. Opus 4.8 (May 2026) leads on SWE-bench Pro (69.2%), OSWorld (83.4%), GDPval-AA (1890 Elo), and HLE (57.9% with tools).
