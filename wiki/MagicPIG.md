tldr: "LSH-based KV cache selection: uses locality-sensitive hashing to retrieve the top-K most relevant KV pairs per query without scanning the full cache."

## TL;DR
Instead of evicting KV entries, MagicPIG keeps the full cache but retrieves only the top-K most relevant entries per query step using LSH (locality-sensitive hashing). This turns exact attention into approximate retrieval — O(K) cost regardless of sequence length.
