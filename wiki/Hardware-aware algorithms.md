# Hardware-Aware Algorithms

A *hardware-aware* algorithm is one whose design explicitly accounts for the fact that the cost of an operation on modern accelerators is dominated by *where its operands live*, not by how many flops it does. Three families dominate: (i) **fusion** — combine consecutive ops into one kernel so intermediate tensors stay in [[SRAM]] (FlashAttention, [[Hardware-Aware Scan]]); (ii) **tiling** — slice big tensors into SRAM-sized blocks, process one block at a time, write outputs back to [[HBM]] only at the end; (iii) **layout** — reorganize how data is laid out across the [[Memory hierarchy]] so accesses are contiguous and prefetcher-friendly (PagedAttention, FlashDecoding). The pattern is explicit in the [[Mamba]] and [[Transformers Are SSMs]] papers — same recurrence math, but the algorithm that runs it is co-designed with the GPU.
