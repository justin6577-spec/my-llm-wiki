tldr: "Hardware-integrated KV cache management: moves KV eviction and compression decisions into the memory controller rather than the GPU compute stack."

## TL;DR
NeuralKV offloads KV cache management (eviction, compression, retrieval) to a hardware unit co-located with DRAM, removing it from the GPU's critical path and enabling finer-grained cache control without host-side overhead.
