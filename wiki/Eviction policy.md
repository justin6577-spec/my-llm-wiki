# Eviction Policy

Once you've decided to evict KV-cache entries to fit a budget, you need a policy: which entries get dropped? LRU (least-recently-used) is the operating-systems default — drop oldest first — but for LLMs it discards the [[Attention sinks]] that anchor every head, and quality collapses. Better policies use attention scores: track which past tokens received the most attention mass over recent decoding steps and drop the ones that received the least. [[H2O eviction]] is the canonical example. The most robust policies combine rules: always retain the first 4 tokens (sinks) and the most recent $W$ tokens (locality), evict from the middle by attention score.
