tldr: "Cross-Layer Attention: adjacent Transformer layers share one KV cache instead of each maintaining their own, halving KV memory with minimal quality loss."

## TL;DR
CLA groups pairs of consecutive layers to share a single KV cache. Layer N computes keys/values, layer N+1 reuses them via a cross-attention read instead of projecting its own. KV memory drops by ~50%; quality loss is <1% on standard benchmarks.
