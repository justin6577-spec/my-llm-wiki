# Paged Attention

Naive KV-cache allocation gives each request a contiguous HBM region sized for its maximum context length — wasteful if the request is shorter, and prone to fragmentation across many concurrent requests. **PagedAttention** (Kwon et al. 2023, the basis of vLLM) borrows the operating-systems trick: chop the cache into fixed-size blocks (16 tokens × $h_kv$ heads × $d$ dimensions per page), maintain a per-request page table, and allocate pages on demand. Two large wins: (i) zero fragmentation — pages are uniform, allocator is trivial — and (ii) **prefix sharing**, where multiple requests with the same prompt prefix share the same physical pages, dramatically improving throughput for chat and tool-calling workloads. The de-facto standard for production LLM serving.
