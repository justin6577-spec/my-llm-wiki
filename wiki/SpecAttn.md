tldr: "Speculative decoding with sparse attention verification: the target model only runs attention on draft tokens that pass a sparsity-based pre-filter."

## TL;DR
SpecAttn reduces verification cost in speculative decoding by using a sparse attention pattern during the verification pass — only full attention on tokens flagged as uncertain by a cheap scoring step.
