tldr: "Tensor-core-optimized SSM scan: reformulates the parallel prefix scan as batched GEMMs that land natively on Tensor Cores."

## TL;DR
Standard SSM scans are memory-bound and miss Tensor Core utilization. TensorSSM reformulates the recurrence as matrix operations that map to cuBLAS/cuDNN primitives, achieving near-peak throughput on A100/H100.
