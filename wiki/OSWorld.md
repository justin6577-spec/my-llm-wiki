## TL;DR
OSWorld is the first scalable, truly interactive benchmark for multimodal computer-use agents, running tasks inside real virtual machines (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) with execution-based evaluation scripts. It exposes a massive human-AI gap: humans complete 72.36% of tasks; the best evaluated model manages only 12.24%. This gap is primarily driven by failures in GUI grounding (clicking precise pixels) and lack of operational knowledge about real applications.

## The Problem
Previous computer-use benchmarks fail in one or more of three ways:
1. **No interactive environment** — they provide static demonstration datasets and evaluate via string matching, which wrongly penalizes valid alternative solutions and blocks interactive/RL-style learning.
2. **Application- or domain-locked** — web-only (WebArena, MiniWoB++), coding-only, or similar narrow scopes. Agents trained/evaluated there can't generalize to real multi-app desktop workflows.
3. **Simplified action/observation spaces** — prior executable environments abstract away raw mouse/keyboard into high-level APIs, hiding the actual difficulty of GUI grounding.

None of these benchmarks can test agents on the kind of open-ended, multi-application, cross-interface tasks real users perform daily.

## What It Measures

### Environment
- **Platform**: Real virtual machines (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) controlled via raw keyboard/mouse API and CLI
- **Observation space**: Screenshots, accessibility (a11y) trees, or both
- **Action space**: Raw mouse clicks/drags, keyboard hotkeys, terminal commands, plus `DONE`/`FAIL` signals
- **Task formalism**: Partially Observable MDP (POMDP); max 15 steps per episode
- **Evaluation**: Custom execution-based scripts check final VM state (file contents, UI state, etc.) — binary 0/1 or partial credit

### Benchmark
- **369 tasks** derived from real user workflows, annotated by 9 CS-background authors
- **134 unique evaluation functions** — orders of magnitude more than prior work
- **Application categories**:
  - Web browsers (Chrome)
  - Desktop productivity (LibreOffice Calc, Writer, Impress; VS Code; GIMP; VLC; Thunderbird)
  - OS file I/O
  - Multi-app workflows spanning 2+ applications
- **Task types**: Single-app tasks + multi-app workflow tasks
- **Scoring**: Success Rate (Pass@1 equivalent) — fraction of tasks where execution-based eval returns reward = 1

## Key Results

| Model | Overall Success Rate | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Human | 72.36% | Baseline ceiling; tasks are time-consuming |
| GPT-4V (best config) | 12.24% | Best model overall |
| Claude-3 Opus | ~10% | Competitive with GPT-4V |
| Gemini series | <10% | Both Pro and Ultra variants |
| Qwen-Max | ~5% | Proprietary Chinese model |
| Mixtral / Llama-3 | <5% | Open-source LLMs |
| CogAgent | ~0.99% | Open-source VLM, near floor |
| Any model on multi-app workflows | ≤6.57% | Hardest subset |
| Any model on some app subsets | 0% | Complete failure on certain apps |

**Key ablations:**
- Adding accessibility (a11y) tree helps some models but actively misleads others — effect is model-dependent
- Set-of-Mark prompting provides mixed results
- Higher resolution input roughly **doubles** success rate on screenshot-based tasks but demands longer context

## Why It Matters for LLM Evaluation

- **Real execution, not string matching**: 134 custom eval scripts check actual VM state (file diffs, UI state, cookies, etc.), eliminating false negatives from valid alternative solutions — a fundamental methodological improvement over dataset-only benchmarks
- **The 60-point human-AI gap is a genuine signal**: 72.36% vs. 12.24% on tasks normal users can accomplish, showing frontier VLMs are far from practical computer assistants despite strong performance on static benchmarks
- **Multi-app workflows expose compositional failure**: best model drops to 6.57% on tasks requiring coordination across two or more applications, revealing that sequential single-app capability doesn't compose
- **GUI grounding is the key bottleneck**: analysis shows models systematically fail to predict precise pixel coordinates for clicks, tend toward repetitive action loops, and are confused by unexpected popup windows — failure modes invisible in text-only or simplified-action benchmarks
- **Cross-OS and cross-app scope enables scalability**: built on real VMs with config-file-driven setup, any researcher can add new tasks without building a custom simulator, making it a living benchmark rather than a fixed dataset

## Limitations

- **Contamination risk is low but not zero**: tasks are based on real use cases but the specific initial states and exact evaluation scripts are novel; however, applications themselves (LibreOffice, Chrome) appear in training data
- **369 tasks is relatively small**: covers many apps but individual app subsets can be <20 tasks, making per-app results noisy
- **Max 15 steps**: real computer tasks often require far more interactions; this cap may artificially limit agent strategies and penalize legitimate multi-step approaches
- **VM overhead**: running real VMs makes evaluation slow and computationally expensive compared to text benchmarks, limiting large-scale hyperparameter sweeps
- **English-centric and US-locale**: tasks and apps default to English interfaces; cross-lingual or locale-specific behavior untested
- **Partial credit is rare**: most tasks are binary success/fail, which may undercount meaningful partial progress and makes signal sparse for RL-based training
- **Evaluation script brittleness**: 134 custom scripts are carefully written but edge cases in task completion may still be misclassified; gold states are generated by authors, not crowdsourced at scale
