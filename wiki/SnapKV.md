tldr: "Snapshot KV compression: identifies critical KV positions via attention pattern voting across heads, retaining a fixed-size snapshot per layer."

## TL;DR
SnapKV pools attention weights across all heads to vote on which KV positions are globally important, then keeps only those — creating a compact snapshot. Unlike recency-biased eviction, SnapKV retains semantically critical early tokens.
