# Novel Attention Mechanisms

Cache eviction and compression are post-hoc tricks — the model was trained with full multi-head attention, you're just lossy at serve time. Novel attention mechanisms change the architecture so the cache is structurally smaller from the beginning. [[Multi-Query Attention]] shares K/V across all heads — 32× cache reduction. [[GQA]] is the practical compromise — group-shared K/V, ~4× reduction. [[Compressed Sparse Attention]] and [[Heavily Compressed Attention]] go further: compress every $m$ tokens into one entry, then sparse-select or do dense attention over the compressed sequence. Most invasive (require retraining or fine-tuning) but give the largest memory wins.
