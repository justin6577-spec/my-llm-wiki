## Theme II — Efficient Sequence Modeling

The O(n²) attention cost is fine for short sequences. For long ones it breaks. These papers replace attention with something cheaper.

| Note | Paper | Year | TL;DR |
|---|---|---|---|

## Theme III — Scaling / Parameter Efficiency

Parameters and compute don't have to scale together. These papers decouple them.

| Note | Paper | Year | TL;DR |

## How These Papers Connect

The Transformer (2017) solved sequential training by replacing RNNs with self-attention, achieving O(1) path length between any two tokens — but at the cost of O(n²) compute and a KV cache that grows without bound. That single limitation became the organizing constraint for the next eight years of research.

Mamba (2024) attacks the O(n²) problem directly: it shows that the failure mode of older recurrent models was not compression itself but *blind* compression. Make the SSM parameters depend on the input and you get selective memory — the model decides what to keep and what to forget based on content, not just position. A hardware-aware kernel fusion pass makes this as fast in practice as FlashAttention. Mamba matches Transformer quality at 5× throughput and constant memory per step.

Mixture-of-Experts attacks a different axis: not compute per token but the coupling between parameter count and compute. A dense model can't add knowledge without adding FLOPs. MoE breaks that coupling — route each token to K of N experts, so total parameters scale with N while active compute scales only with K. Switch Transformers prove that top-1 routing works; Mixtral proves that top-2 of 8 SwiGLU experts outperforms LLaMA-2 70B at 5× fewer active parameters.

Nemotron-3 (2025) is the synthesis. It takes Mamba's insight (most sequence processing is cheap recurrence; exact recall needs occasional attention) and MoE's insight (parameters and compute are independent axes), adds LatentMoE to cut the all-to-all communication bottleneck by routing in a compressed latent space, trains the whole thing at NVFP4 precision for 3× hardware throughput, uses multi-token prediction to densify the training signal and enable speculative decoding at inference, and then runs 21-environment simultaneous RL to specialize the model for agentic workloads. The result is a model that is simultaneously cheaper to run, better at long context, and more capable on reasoning tasks than any pure Transformer MoE of comparable size.

DeepSeek-V4 (2026) attacks the same O(n²) problem from a different angle: instead of replacing attention entirely, it keeps the Transformer backbone but radically compresses what attention has to look at. Compressed Sparse Attention (CSA) squeezes every m tokens into one KV entry then sparsely selects the top-k relevant blocks; Heavily Compressed Attention (HCA) compresses even more aggressively and does dense attention over the tiny result. Interleaving the two cuts the KV cache by 10× at 1M tokens relative to DeepSeek-V3.2. Two additional innovations compound the gains: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) expand the residual stream and constrain the mixing matrix to be doubly stochastic — guaranteeing spectral norm ≤ 1 and numerically stable deep stacking — and the Muon optimizer replaces AdamW for most layers by orthogonalizing gradient updates via Newton-Schulz iterations, yielding faster convergence on ill-conditioned loss landscapes. Post-training follows a specialist-then-distill paradigm: independent expert models are trained per domain via SFT + GRPO, then unified into a single model through on-policy distillation. DeepSeek-V4-Pro-Max sets the open-model SOTA on reasoning and knowledge benchmarks.

The through-line: every paper in this wiki is asking the same question — *how do you get the most intelligence per FLOP?* — and each one pries open a different dimension: computation graph (Transformer), memory management (Mamba), parameter efficiency (MoE), hardware utilization (Nemotron-3), long-context attention efficiency (DeepSeek-V4).
