## Theme I — Foundations

The papers that started everything. Everything else in this wiki is either built on them or reacting to them.

| Note | Paper | Year | TL;DR |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[Transformer]] | Attention Is All You Need | 2017 | Self-attention replaces recurrence; any two tokens connect in one step, enabling parallel training and O(1) path length between positions. |

## How These Papers Connect

The **Transformer** (Vaswani et al., 2017) solved sequential training by replacing recurrence with self-attention, giving every token direct access to every other in O(1) path length — but at O(n²) compute and a KV cache that grows without bound. That constraint became the organizing force behind the next decade of research. Three enabling technologies arrived in 2022–2023 to make the Transformer actually usable at scale: [[Flash Attention]] showed that the O(n²) computation was never necessary — tile attention into SRAM and avoid the HBM round-trips entirely for 2–4× wall-clock speedup with zero approximation, enabling 32K+ context training in practice. [[S4]] showed that continuous-time state space models, initialized via the [[HIPPO|HiPPO]] polynomial projection framework, could solve long-range benchmarks (including 16K-step Path-X) where all prior architectures failed — laying the theoretical foundation for every recurrent model that followed. And [[LLaMA 2]] gave the open community the RLHF training blueprint: 7B–70B pretrained-and-chat-tuned models with full GQA scaling details and Ghost Attention for multi-turn instruction consistency, democratizing fine-tuning for thousands of downstream models.

The **linear-RNN revival** of 2023–2024 proved that recurrence, done correctly, can match Transformer quality with O(1)-per-step inference. [[RWKV]] formulated exponential time-decay attention as a pure recurrence, scaling to 14B parameters — the first linear RNN to match Transformer quality at that scale. [[RetNet]] gave the retention mechanism three equivalent computation modes (parallel for training, recurrent for O(1) decode, chunkwise for long sequences), achieving 15.6× higher throughput than Transformer at 8K context. [[Griffin]] showed that RG-LRU plus local sliding-window attention matches LLaMA-2 at 7× fewer training tokens — proving the hybrid is more data-efficient than pure attention. [[Mamba]] closed the remaining quality gap by making SSM parameters input-dependent, so the model selectively compresses context by *content* rather than position alone, paired with a hardware-aware kernel fusion pass. [[Transformers Are SSMs]] unified everything: selective SSMs and attention are both parameterizations of structured semiseparable matrices, giving Mamba-2 which is 2–8× faster than Mamba-1 while inheriting FlashAttention IO-awareness, tensor parallelism, and sequence parallelism from the Transformer toolbox. [[xLSTM]] took the third path — neither SSM nor attention but a modernized 1997 LSTM, fixed with exponential gating (a single token can override stored memory) and d×d matrix memory (cell becomes a learned key-value store) — closing the quality gap at billion-parameter scale.

**Mixture-of-Experts** (Switch Transformers / [[Mixtral]]) attacked a different axis: decouple parameter count from compute by routing each token to K of N expert FFNs — more knowledge without more FLOPs. [[Nemotron-3]] (NVIDIA, 2025) synthesizes all three themes: Mamba-2 recurrence, sparse attention, LatentMoE (routes in a compressed latent space to cut all-to-all communication by d/ℓ), NVFP4 training (3× hardware throughput over BF16), multi-token prediction (denser training signal + free speculative drafts at inference), and 21-environment simultaneous RL — into a production system delivering 7.5× throughput over comparably-sized Transformer MoEs at 1M context. [[DeepSeek_V4]] (2026) attacks the O(n²) problem from the Transformer side rather than replacing it: Compressed Sparse Attention squeezes m tokens into one KV entry then sparse-selects the top-k relevant blocks; Heavily Compressed Attention goes coarser for distant context; together they cut the KV cache 10× at 1M tokens. Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections expand and stabilize the residual stream via a doubly-stochastic mixing matrix (spectral norm ≤ 1 guaranteed); the Muon optimizer orthogonalizes gradient updates for faster convergence. Post-training distills specialist expert models into a unified model via on-policy rollouts.

The **inference layer** runs orthogonally to every architecture choice. [[Medusa]] attaches K frozen MLP heads to an existing LLM that predict K future tokens simultaneously — tree attention verifies all candidate continuations in one forward pass, 2.2–2.8× lossless speedup without a separate draft model. [[EAGLE]] drafts at the feature level (second-to-last hidden state), feeding the actual next token into the draft input to collapse the feature uncertainty problem — 3–3.5× lossless speedup on 70B models. These pair with [[KV Cache Optimization]] (2026), which maps five families of cache techniques to seven production workload scenarios (no single strategy dominates), and with [[FlashAttention-2]] (2023), which pushes GPU attention utilization to 50–73% of peak FLOPS by fixing warp scheduling. The [[Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks]] survey explains the binding constraint behind every technique: LLM inference is memory-bandwidth-bound, not compute-bound. Reading the model and KV cache from HBM is the bottleneck. Every paper in this wiki — from FlashAttention's tiling to Mamba's hardware-aware scan to EAGLE's feature drafting — is answering the same question: *how do you move fewer bytes between silicon and memory per token of intelligence produced?*

**If you want the math:** [[Transformer]] (attention) → [[S4]] (SSM, HiPPO, Cauchy kernel) → [[Mamba]] (selectivity) → [[Transformers Are SSMs]] (semiseparable matrices, SSD) → [[xLSTM]] (exponential gating + matrix memory)

**If you care about silicon:** [[Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks]] → [[Flash Attention]] → [[FlashAttention-2]] → [[KV Cache Optimization]] → [[Hardware-Aware Scan]]

**If you want to understand the linear-RNN family:** [[S4]] → [[RWKV]] → [[RetNet]] → [[Griffin]] → [[Mamba]] → [[Transformers Are SSMs]]
