# Draft Model

Speculative decoding amortizes one forward pass of the big model across multiple generated tokens by having a *fast* draft model propose them first. The draft model can be: (i) a small standalone LM trained to mimic the target's distribution, (ii) an early-exit head that takes the target's intermediate-layer representations and predicts a few steps ahead (EAGLE, EAGLE-3), or (iii) the target model's own [[Multi-Token Prediction]] heads — zero extra parameters because the heads exist for free as a training byproduct. The draft has to be *fast enough* that drafting + verifying $K$ tokens costs less wall-clock than $K$ direct verifier passes; that constraint is what limits how large the draft model can be.
