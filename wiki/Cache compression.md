# Cache Compression

Where eviction throws information away, compression keeps every entry but stores it in fewer bytes. INT8 quantization of K and V is the standard production setting — ~2× smaller cache, near-zero quality loss. INT4 cuts size another 2× with mild perplexity hit and is common in long-context serving. [[NVFP4]] gives most of the INT4 win with better numerical behavior on outliers. Low-rank K/V projection takes a different angle: project K and V down to dimension $d' < d$ before storing, restore at attention time. Compression composes well with other strategies: GQA + INT4 + [[Paged attention]] is a typical production stack.
