# Cache Eviction

When the KV cache hits a memory budget, eviction policies decide which entries to drop. The naïvest is sliding-window — keep the last $W$ tokens — but that destroys long-range recall. Smarter policies (H2O, StreamingLLM, attention-sink retention) use the attention scores themselves to identify which tokens carry information vs. which are noise. The crucial empirical finding is that the **first few tokens** of every sequence (the [[Attention sinks]]) accumulate disproportionate attention mass and must be kept; evict them and quality collapses. Cache eviction is cheap to deploy (no retraining) but always lossy — for accuracy-critical workloads, prefer [[Cache compression]] or [[Novel attention mechanisms]] instead.
