tldr: "Hybrid linear recurrence + KV cache: a RWKV-style recurrent layer feeds a compressed state into a small attention layer with bounded KV, combining sub-quadratic training with O(1) inference."

## TL;DR
GoldFinch stacks a RWKV-7-style recurrent block with a small local attention block that has a capped KV cache. The recurrent layer compresses history cheaply; attention resolves short-range interactions precisely. Inference cost is O(1) per step.
