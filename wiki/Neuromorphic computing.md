# Neuromorphic Computing

Neuromorphic chips reject the dense-matmul model of computation in favor of event-driven, sparse, asynchronous communication patterns inspired by biological neurons. Each "neuron" on the chip integrates incoming spikes and emits its own spike when it crosses a threshold. The advantage is energy: a chip that only fires when something interesting happens uses orders of magnitude less power than one that does dense matmul on every tick. The disadvantage for LLMs: modern Transformers and SSMs are intrinsically dense and synchronous, so they don't naturally map onto neuromorphic substrates. Active research area for event-driven sensing (neuromorphic vision, audio), still niche for dense neural network workloads.
