# Hybrid Memory (KV-Cache Tiering)

When the KV cache exceeds HBM capacity, you have two choices: shrink it ([[Cache compression]] or [[Cache eviction]]) or *page* it across slower memory tiers. Hybrid-memory approaches lay the cache out in fixed-size pages (PagedAttention's standard is 16 tokens per page), keep the active pages in HBM, and migrate cold pages to host DRAM or NVMe. The tier hierarchy ([[Memory hierarchy]]) gives you tens of GB → hundreds of GB → terabytes of effective cache capacity at the cost of latency on the colder tiers. Critical for million-token contexts where the cache is fundamentally larger than HBM.
