## TL;DR

The `state-spaces/mamba` GitHub repository is the canonical implementation of three generations of selective [[SSM|state space models]]. [[Mamba]] (v1) introduced input-dependent parameters with a hardware-aware parallel scan, achieving [[Transformer]]-competitive perplexity with **5× faster inference** at 2K sequence length. [[Mamba-2]] restructured the recurrence into the [[SSD]] (Structured State Space Duality) framework, enabling tensor-core matmuls and **2–8× training throughput improvement** over Mamba-1. Mamba-3 (2025) adds MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SSM structure for improved long-range recall with an inference-first design philosophy. The repo ships pip-installable CUDA kernels, pretrained checkpoints (130M–2.8B parameters trained on 300B tokens), and direct integration with `lm-evaluation-harness`.

## Repository Overview

This is the **official implementation** of the Mamba family of models, including three generations of selective state space models. All models are available as `pip install mamba-ssm`.

---

## Key Concepts

- **[[Mamba]]** — Selective [[SSM]] (S6) with input-dependent $(A, B, C)$ parameters; breaks the time-invariance constraint of classical SSMs to enable content-based reasoning
- **[[SSM|Selective State Space Model]]** — Continuous-time system discretized per token; Mamba-1 uses state size $N=16$, Mamba-2 expands to $N=64$–$128$
- **[[SSD]] (Structured State Space Duality)** — [[Mamba-2]]'s core algorithm; scalar-times-identity $A_t$ constraint enables rewriting the recurrence as a masked matrix multiplication, unlocking tensor-core acceleration
- **Hardware-Aware Scan** — Fused CUDA kernel that keeps the scan state in SRAM rather than [[HBM]], eliminating the memory-bandwidth bottleneck; inspired by [[FlashAttention]]'s IO-aware design
- **Chunkwise recurrent computation** — Splits sequences into chunks (e.g., 256 tokens); each chunk is computed with a matmul (parallel, fast) and chunk boundaries are connected by a short recurrent scan
- **MIMO SSM (Mamba-3)** — Multiple-input multiple-output extension; rank-$r$ input/output projections instead of rank-1, controlled by `mimo_rank` parameter
- **[[KV cache]] analogy** — Mamba's fixed-size recurrent state (e.g., $B \times D \times N$ floats) replaces the linearly growing [[KV cache]] of [[Transformer]]s; constant memory per token at inference
- **Recurrent inference** — At generation time, all three Mamba variants run as pure RNNs with **O(1) memory and O(1) compute per step**, vs. [[Attention]]'s O(L) memory and O(L) compute
- **[[Sequence parallelism]]** — [[Mamba-2]]'s chunkwise formulation naturally enables distributed sequence parallelism across devices via the SSD structure
- **Diagonal recurrence** — Scalar $a_t$ (vs. full matrix $A_t$ in general SSMs) is the key structural constraint that makes [[SSD]] tractable while preserving expressivity

---

## Mamba-1

- **Core:** Selective SSM (S6) with input-dependent $(A, B, C)$ parameters
- **Algorithm:** Hardware-aware parallel associative scan (see [[Hardware-Aware Scan]])
- **State size:** $N = 16$ (limited by scan efficiency)
- **Training:** Scan-based, no tensor cores
- **Inference speed:** **5× faster** than [[Transformer]] of equal size at sequence length 2K; gap grows with sequence length
- **Memory:** Constant recurrent state replaces growing [[KV cache]]; e.g., 2.8B model state is ~100MB regardless of context length

```python
from mamba_ssm import Mamba
model = Mamba(d_model=16, d_state=16, d_conv=4, expand=2).cuda()
```

---

## Mamba-2 (SSD)

- **Core:** [[SSD]] layer — scalar-times-identity $A_t$, multi-head structure
- **Algorithm:** Chunkwise matmul + short scan (see [[Chunkwise recurrent]])
- **State size:** $N = 64$–$128$ (tensor-core friendly; **4–8× larger** than Mamba-1)
- **Training:** **2–8× faster** than Mamba-1 (2× at small batch; up to 8× at large batch on A100)
- **Perplexity:** Matches or slightly exceeds Mamba-1 at equal parameter count; both competitive with [[Transformer]]++ on Pile

Key implementation files:
- `mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2.py` — full Mamba-2 block
- `mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2_simple.py` — simplified version
- `mamba_ssm/modules/ssd_minimal.py` — minimal SSD (Listing 1 from paper)

```python
from mamba_ssm import Mamba2
model = Mamba2(d_model=16, d_state=64, d_conv=4, expand=2).cuda()
```

---

## Mamba-3

- **Core:** MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SSM for improved expressivity
- **Focus:** Inference-first design, improved long-range recall
- **Parameters:** `is_mimo=True`, `mimo_rank`, `chunk_size`

```python
from mamba_ssm import Mamba3
model = Mamba3(d_model=768, d_state=128, headdim=64, is_mimo=True,
               mimo_rank=4, chunk_size=16, dtype=torch.bfloat16).cuda()
```

## Pretrained Models (HuggingFace: `state-spaces`)

| Model | Params | Tokens | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mamba-130m` .. `mamba-2.8b` | 130M–2.8B | 300B | Mamba-1, Pile |
| `mamba2-130m` .. `mamba2-2.7b` | 130M–2.7B | 300B | Mamba-2 / [[SSD]] |
| `transformerpp-2.7b` | 2.7B | 300B | [[Transformer]]++ baseline |
| `mamba2attn-2.7b` | 2.7B | 300B | [[Mamba-2]] + [[Attention]] hybrid |
| `mamba-2.8b-slimpj` | 2.8B | 600B | SlimPajama dataset |

Model dimensions follow GPT-3 conventions (24–64 layers, 768–2560 hidden dim).

## Hardware Requirements

- Linux, NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 11.6+), PyTorch 1.12+
- AMD GPU support available (see repo docs)
- Optional: `causal-conv1d` for efficient Conv1d in Mamba block

## Evaluation

Zero-shot evaluation via `lm-evaluation-harness`:

```sh
lm_eval --model mamba_ssm \
        --model_args pretrained=state-spaces/mamba2-2.7b \
        --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag,piqa,arc_easy,arc_challenge,winogrande,openbookqa \
        --device cuda --batch_size 256
```

## Why It Matters

- **Inference efficiency at scale:** [[Mamba]] models generate tokens with **O(1) memory per step** (fixed recurrent state) vs. [[Transformer]]'s O(L) [[KV cache]]; at 16K context, a 2.8B Mamba-2 uses ~200MB of state memory vs. ~14GB KV cache for an equivalent [[Transformer]]
- **Training throughput breakthrough:** [[Mamba-2]]'s [[SSD]] algorithm achieves **2–8× higher training throughput** than Mamba-1 on A100 GPUs by replacing CUDA scan kernels with BLAS-level tensor-core matmuls, enabling larger state sizes ($N=128$ vs $N=16$) at the same cost
- **Ecosystem and reproducibility:** With 9,000+ GitHub stars, pip-installable kernels, and direct `lm-evaluation-harness` integration, this repo has become the reference benchmark for alternative architectures like [[RWKV]], [[xLSTM]], [[RetNet]], [[Griffin]], and [[Jamba]], enabling fair apples-to-apples comparison at the 130M–2.8B scale

## Open Questions

1. **MIMO expressivity vs. efficiency tradeoff:** Mamba-3's MIMO structure increases expressivity via rank-$r$ projections, but the optimal `mimo_rank` relative to `d_state` for different task types (recall-intensive vs. language modeling) remains poorly characterized — does higher rank always help, or does it overfit on shorter contexts?

2. **Hybrid architecture design principles:** The `mamba2attn-2.7b` checkpoint mixes [[Mamba-2]] and [[Attention]] layers, and [[Jamba]] explores similar hybrids; there is no principled theory yet for *which* layers should be attention (1 in 8? 1 in 4?) and whether the optimal ratio changes with model scale, context length, or task distribution.

3. **Long-context recall ceiling:** Fixed-size recurrent state fundamentally limits exact retrieval from long contexts (e.g., "needle in a haystack" tasks), unlike [[Attention]] with full [[KV cache]]; whether Mamba-3's MIMO design or future architectural changes (e.g., learned state expansion) can close this gap without sacrificing O(1) inference memory remains an open research direction.
