# Verification Step

Given $K$ draft tokens proposed by the [[Draft model]], the verifier runs **one** forward pass with all $K$ tokens visible at once (causal-mask attention, just like training). It produces $K$ probability distributions — one per position — each conditioned on the actual prompt + the previously accepted draft tokens. For each position $k$, the verifier accepts the draft if $\min(1, p_\text{verifier}(t_k) / p_\text{draft}(t_k)) \ge u$ where $u \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)$ — a rejection-sampling rule that's provably equivalent in distribution to direct sampling from the verifier. The first rejection ends the accepted prefix; the verifier samples its own token at that position, and the loop restarts. The whole verification pass costs roughly the same wall-clock as one normal autoregressive step — that's why it's a win.
