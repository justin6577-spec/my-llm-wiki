# KV Offloading

When a single request's KV cache exceeds the HBM available — common for million-token RAG, long-document QA, or persistent chat sessions — you have to move cache bytes out of HBM. **KV offloading** pages cold blocks out to host DRAM (PCIe latency, ~10 GB/s) or NVMe SSD (~3 GB/s). The page-migration cost is paid only when the model actually needs to attend to a cold block, so locality of attention determines whether offloading is fast or slow. Used in conjunction with [[Paged attention]] (so blocks are uniformly sized and addressable) and often [[Cache compression]] (so transferred bytes are smaller).
