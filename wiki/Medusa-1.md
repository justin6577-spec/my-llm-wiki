tldr: "The variant of Medusa where only the extra decoding heads are fine-tuned, while the backbone LLM is frozen. Guarantees lossless inference — identical output distribution to the original model — at 2.2× speedup."

## TL;DR

Medusa-1 fine-tunes only the K extra [[Medusa heads]] on a dataset of (context, next-K-tokens) pairs. The backbone LLM's weights are frozen throughout training. Because the backbone is unchanged, Medusa-1 guarantees **lossless inference**: the accepted tokens follow exactly the original model's distribution (via speculative decoding's rejection sampling mechanism). Speedup: ~2.2× with no quality loss.

## Why It Matters

- **Zero-risk deployment.** Medusa-1 is a drop-in speedup for any pretrained model — quality guaranteed identical to the unmodified model.
- **No retraining of the backbone.** Only the small MLP heads need training, which is fast (hours on a single GPU).
