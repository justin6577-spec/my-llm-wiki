# Sliding Window Attention

The simplest possible [[Cache eviction]] strategy: at every decode step, drop any cache entry older than $W$ tokens. Memory becomes $O(W)$ regardless of total context length. Attention quality degrades smoothly as soon as the relevant context is past the window — so the window has to be sized to fit the longest dependency you care about. Used in Mistral-7B (W = 4096) and a number of other models as a pragmatic compromise. Crucially **does not survive on its own** at long context — you also need to retain the [[Attention sinks]] (the first few tokens), as the StreamingLLM paper showed.
