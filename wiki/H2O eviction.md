# H2O Eviction (Heavy Hitter Oracle)

H2O ranks every cache entry by the sum of attention weights it has received across all prior decoding steps — the entries that historically mattered most are kept ("heavy hitters"), the rest are evicted as the budget tightens. Compared to sliding-window, H2O retains semantically important early tokens that would otherwise scroll off. Compared to keeping everything, H2O bounds memory at a configurable budget. Quality loss is mild but non-zero — for accuracy-critical workloads use [[Cache compression]] instead.
