tldr: "Hybrid Mamba-attention that puts SSM and attention heads in parallel within each layer, letting them specialize: SSM for recall, attention for precision."

## TL;DR
Hymba runs Mamba and attention heads side-by-side within every layer rather than alternating them. The two mechanisms complement each other — SSM accumulates long-range patterns, attention focuses on precise token interactions.
