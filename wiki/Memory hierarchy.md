# Memory Hierarchy

Every modern accelerator has a strict memory hierarchy. On a GPU: thread-local registers (latency 1, capacity tiny) → on-chip [[SRAM]] / shared memory (latency ~10 cycles, capacity ~100 KB per SM) → L2 cache (~50 cycles, ~50 MB) → [[HBM]] (~500 cycles, ~80 GB) → host RAM (~10 µs, ~1 TB) → NVMe (~100 µs, ~10 TB). Each tier is 10–100× larger and 10× slower than the previous. The rule of thumb: **performance is set by where your data lives**. If your kernel reads HBM for every operand, you're HBM-bound. If you can stage operands into SRAM and reuse them across many ops, you're compute-bound — which is the regime you want.
