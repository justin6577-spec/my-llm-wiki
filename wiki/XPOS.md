## TL;DR

XPOS (Sun et al., 2022) is a positional encoding that multiplies the query and key vectors by position-dependent scalars $\xi_m$ that decay exponentially with distance: the attention score between positions $m$ and $n$ includes a factor $\xi_m / \xi_n = \zeta^{n-m}$ for $\zeta < 1$. This decaying attention aligns naturally with [[RetNet]]'s retention mechanism, and the resulting model extrapolates better to sequences longer than those seen during training.

## Intuition

Standard [[RoPE]] rotates query/key vectors by position-dependent angles, encoding relative positions through the dot product. XPOS adds an exponential decay on top: the effective attention between positions $m$ and $n$ decays with $|m - n|$ even before the softmax. For [[RetNet]], this decay is the retention mechanism's $\gamma^{n-m}$ factor — XPOS provides the positional encoding that works harmoniously with this structure.

The practical effect: when the model is evaluated on sequences longer than its training context, the XPOS decay naturally suppresses very distant tokens (distance > training length), preventing out-of-distribution positional encodings from destabilizing the attention.

## Why It Matters

- **It enables RetNet to generalize to longer sequences than training.** The decay structure is self-regularizing at long distances.
- **It's designed for the retention mechanism.** Unlike RoPE (which targets softmax attention), XPOS is designed for linear attention with decay — matching RetNet's architecture.
