## TL;DR
Claude Opus 4.8 (released May 28, 2026) leads on most agentic benchmarks — SWE-bench Pro (69.2%), OSWorld-Verified (83.4%), GDPval-AA (1890 Elo) — while GPT-5.5 edges it on Terminal-Bench 2.1 (78.2% vs 74.6%). Pricing unchanged at $5/$25 per 1M tokens. 4× improvement in code honesty (unflagged code flaws).

## What Each Benchmark Measures

- **[[SWE-bench Pro]]** — Hard real-world GitHub issue resolution, multi-file enterprise codebases, less contamination than the Verified variant
- **Terminal-Bench 2.1** — Linux shell agent tasks, bash commands, deterministic scoring; moved to v2.1 (not directly comparable to 4.7 era results)
- **[[Humanity's Last Exam]] (HLE)** — 2,500 expert-level academic questions across math, science, humanities — designed to resist saturation
- **[[OSWorld]]-Verified** — GUI agent controlling real desktop OS (Ubuntu/Windows/macOS) via mouse/keyboard; uses updated harness in 4.8
- **GDPval-AA** — Real economic value tasks, Elo-style rating by Artificial Analysis — 1890 Elo, 121 points ahead of GPT-5.5
- **Finance Agent v2** — Financial analysis agentic tasks

## Key Takeaways

- Opus 4.8 leads on 5 of 6 benchmarks
- GPT-5.5 wins Terminal-Bench 2.1 (78.2% vs 74.6%)
- **Biggest gap:** GDPval-AA — 121 Elo points ahead of GPT-5.5
- **Most significant non-benchmark change:** 4× reduction in unflagged code flaws (honesty improvement)
- **Tool-use uplift:** HLE with tools 57.9% vs without tools 49.8% — +8.1 points shows strong tool augmentation
- SWE-bench Pro 10-point lead over GPT-5.5 is the most contamination-resistant signal

## Why It Matters

- SWE-bench Pro is the most contamination-resistant coding benchmark available in 2026
- GDPval-AA measures real economic value delivered — hardest to game via training
- HLE with tools represents the frontier of tool-augmented reasoning
- Finance Agent v2 demonstrates domain-specific agentic capability

## Limitations

- OSWorld harness changed between versions — direct comparison to prior releases is not clean
- Terminal-Bench moved to v2.1 — not directly comparable to Opus 4.7 era results
- No vision-specific benchmarks published for Opus 4.8
- Self-reported by Anthropic — independent third-party verification pending
- GDPval-AA uses Elo, which is relative to other entrants at time of evaluation

## Data Quality Note

> Scores sourced from Anthropic official announcement (May 2026).
> Terminal-Bench 2.1 uses different harnesses across models (Codex CLI for GPT-5.5; Terminus-2 for others) — not directly comparable.
> OSWorld harness was updated between Opus 4.6 and 4.8 — part of the OSWorld gain is methodology.
> See [[Data Quality Standards]] for details on discrepancies and verification sources.
