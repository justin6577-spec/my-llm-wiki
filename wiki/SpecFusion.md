tldr: "Speculative decoding for multimodal models: separate lightweight draft heads for text vs. image tokens, verified jointly by the full model."

## TL;DR
SpecFusion extends speculative decoding to multimodal LLMs (text + image) by using modality-specific draft heads that propose tokens in parallel, then verifying both modalities in a single target model forward pass.
