tldr: "Mixed-precision LLM deployment on hardware accelerators: assigns different bit-widths per layer based on sensitivity, minimizing quality loss at a given memory budget."

## TL;DR
LLM-PQ profiles each layer's quantization sensitivity and assigns bit-widths (e.g. 2-bit for insensitive layers, 8-bit for critical ones) to hit a target memory footprint with minimal perplexity degradation.
