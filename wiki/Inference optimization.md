## TL;DR

Inference optimization covers everything that happens after a model is trained: how to serve it faster, cheaper, and at larger scale. The key insight from [[Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks]]: LLM inference is **memory-bandwidth bound**, not compute-bound. Each generated token requires reading the entire model from HBM. Optimizations target:

1. **Reduce memory reads**: [[Speculative Decoding]] generates $K$ tokens per model read; [[KV Cache Optimization]] reduces the cache that must be read per step
2. **Reduce the model size**: quantization (FP8, INT8, NVFP4) shrinks the model proportionally
3. **Increase arithmetic intensity**: larger batches amortize the model load across more tokens
4. **Overlap compute with memory**: speculative decoding, continuous batching, async prefill

The three main categories in this wiki:
- **Speculative decoding**: [[Speculative Decoding]], [[Medusa]], [[EAGLE]]
- **KV cache management**: [[KV Cache Optimization]], [[GQA]], [[Sliding window attention]]
- **Hardware-aware kernels**: [[Flash Attention]], [[Hardware-Aware Scan]]

## Why It Matters

- **Inference cost dominates training cost over a model's lifetime.** A model trained once is served billions of times. Optimizing inference by 2× is worth more than training 2× faster.
- **It enables deployment at scale.** Without inference optimization, serving 70B models at reasonable cost is infeasible.
