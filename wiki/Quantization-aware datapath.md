# Quantization-Aware Datapath

Software quantization is easy — pick a scale factor, round, store INT8. Getting *speedup* from it is harder: if your hardware multiplies INT8 inputs but accumulates and stores in FP16, you only save bandwidth, not compute. A **quantization-aware datapath** is a hardware multiplier that consumes INT8/FP8/[[NVFP4]] operands and accumulates in a slightly higher-precision register (typically INT32 or FP32) — keeping the full pipeline at low precision until a final dequantization step. Modern tensor cores (H100 INT8 + FP8, B200 NVFP4) include exactly these datapaths and that is why low-precision inference gives the throughput boost it does. Without the matching silicon, low-precision is a memory-bandwidth optimization only, not a compute one.
