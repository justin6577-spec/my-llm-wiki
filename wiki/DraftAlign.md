tldr: "Fine-tunes the draft model in speculative decoding to better match the target model's output distribution, increasing token acceptance rate."

## TL;DR
The acceptance rate in speculative decoding is bottlenecked by distribution mismatch between draft and target. DraftAlign trains the draft model with a KL-divergence loss against the target, pushing acceptance rate toward 90%+ on benchmarks.
