# Decode Phase (LLM Inference)

After [[Prefill]] populates the cache, decode generates one token at a time. Each decode step: load the full model weights from HBM, load the entire KV cache from HBM, compute one new $(K_t, V_t)$ pair, append it to the cache, sample one output token. The matmuls per step are tiny — they don't saturate compute — and the binding constraint is *moving bytes from HBM*. Decode latency scales with model size + cache size + bandwidth. This is the regime where every KV-cache trick (compression, eviction, paging, GQA) matters most, and where [[Speculative Decoding]] gives its biggest wins by amortizing one HBM sweep across multiple generated tokens.
