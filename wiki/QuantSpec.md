tldr: "Combines KV cache quantization with speculative decoding: a quantized draft model proposes tokens, the full model verifies, halving memory while maintaining speed."

## TL;DR
QuantSpec runs a 4-bit quantized draft model for speculation and a higher-precision target model for verification. The draft's low memory footprint means both models fit simultaneously, enabling speculative decoding without extra GPU memory cost.
