## TL;DR

Standard [[Speculative Decoding]] requires a separate draft model (typically a smaller version of the target model) to propose candidate tokens. Draft-model-free methods achieve the same speedup pattern without this second model, by embedding the drafting mechanism inside or alongside the target model.

The main approaches:
- **[[Medusa]]**: K extra MLP heads on the frozen backbone predict K future tokens
- **[[Lookahead Decoding]]**: Jacobi iteration with no extra parameters
- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) heads**: auxiliary heads trained with the backbone (used in DeepSeek, Nemotron-3)

## Why It Matters

- **Operational simplicity.** No need to version-match a draft model to the target model, host two models, or worry about draft model size/quality tradeoffs.
- **Zero memory overhead for the draft model.** Medusa heads are tiny; Lookahead uses no extra parameters.

## Where It Appears in This Wiki

- [[Medusa]] — the primary draft-model-free method; extra heads replace the draft model
