## Foundations

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[Transformer]] | Self-attention replaces recurrence. Any token attends to any other in O(1). |
| [[LLaMA 2]] | Meta's open RLHF-aligned 7B–70B models. GQA at scale. The base for most community finetunes. |
| [[Mamba]] | Selective state spaces. Linear-time sequence modeling that matches Transformer quality. |

## Efficient Sequence Modeling

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[S4]] | First SSM to solve 16K-step tasks. HiPPO matrix + Cauchy kernel. The theoretical root of Mamba. |
| [[RWKV]] | Linear attention as an RNN. Trains like a Transformer, decodes with O(1) memory. Scaled to 14B. |
| [[RetNet]] | Three computation modes (parallel/recurrent/chunkwise). 15.6× throughput over Transformer at inference. |
| [[Transformers Are SSMs]] | Attention and selective SSMs are the same structured-matrix object. SSD framework gives Mamba-2: 2–8× faster, matmul-friendly. |
| [[xLSTM]] | LSTM rehab — exponential gating + matrix memory. Competitive with Transformer at 1B+ scale, O(1) inference. |
| [[Griffin]] | Google DeepMind hybrid: RG-LRU + local attention. Matches LLaMA-2 at 7× fewer training tokens. |

## Scaling

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[Mixture-of-Experts]] | Decouple parameters from compute. Route tokens to specialized FFN subnetworks. |

## Hardware & Systems

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[Flash Attention]] | IO-aware exact attention: tiles into SRAM, never writes T×T matrix to HBM. 2–4× wall-clock speedup. |
| [[FlashAttention-2]] | Better warp scheduling pushes GPU to 50–73% peak FLOPS. 225 TFLOPS/s per A100 training GPT models. |
| [[Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks]] | Survey of GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, LPUs, in/near-memory. The bottleneck is bandwidth, not FLOPS. |

## Inference Optimization

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[Medusa]] | K extra decoding heads + tree attention. 2.2× lossless speedup. No separate draft model needed. |
| [[EAGLE]] | Feature-level draft model. 3–3.5× lossless speedup on LLaMA-2-Chat 70B — best in the speculative family. |
| [[KV Cache Optimization]] | Five families: eviction, compression, hybrid memory, novel attention, combination. No universal winner — pick by workload. |
| [[Speculative Decoding]] | Fast draft proposes K tokens; large model verifies all K in one pass. ~2× throughput on long generations. |

## Modern Systems

| Article | One Line |
|---|---|
| [[Nemotron-3]] | Hybrid Mamba-Transformer-MoE. 3x throughput over pure Transformer MoE at same quality. |
| [[DeepSeek_V4]] | CSA + HCA compressed attention cuts KV cache 10× at 1M tokens. MoE + Muon optimizer. SOTA open model. |
