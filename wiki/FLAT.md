tldr: "Hardware-aware implementation of linear attention that maps the recurrent form to SRAM-resident streaming, avoiding HBM bandwidth bottlenecks."

## TL;DR
FLAT (Fast Linear Attention) redesigns the compute schedule for linear attention so the recurrent form runs in SRAM rather than bouncing through HBM, achieving GPU/accelerator bandwidth utilization comparable to FlashAttention.
